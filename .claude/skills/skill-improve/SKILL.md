Read and apply `docs/COLLABORATIVE-DESIGN-PRINCIPLE.md`,
`standards/evidence-lifecycle.md` and `standards/notes-adr-sync.md` for scoped
authority, exact evidence and decision ownership. Existing named authority
continues; analysis is read-only and report-only excludes input/index/state writes.


## User Guide

- When to use: Improve a skill using a test-fix-retest loop. Runs static checks, proposes targeted fixes, rewrites the skill, re-tests, and evaluates actual semantic/check regressions before a scoped keep or guarded revert.
- Inputs: Command arguments: `/skill-improve [skill-name]`; project artifacts referenced below; user decisions and approvals before writes.
- Outputs: Proposed skill patch, before/after test comparison, and optional improvement evidence written only after user approval.
- Memory-bank writes: Only when Memory Bank is initialized and each named write effect is covered: `memory_bank/t3_archive/skill_testing/improvements/skill-improve-[name]-[YYYY-MM-DD].md`. Retest coverage is updated by `/skill-test`.
- Next steps: Follow the workflow hand-off or next-step guidance below; recommendations do not auto-run and require explicit user command/approval.

## Phase 0: Domain Routing

Determine the target skill's advertised domain capability before improving it.
`[Both]` below describes an artifact supporting both domains, not a project-domain
enum. Project routing uses concrete Game or Product scope, or unresolved Unknown,
under `standards/technical-preferences.md`.
- **[Game]** when the skill primarily supports game workflows, preserve game examples, player/gameplay/engine terminology, playtest references, and game CDD templates.
- **[Product]** when the skill is expected to support general projects, add product branches for API/CLI/web/data workflows, technology stack terms, user value, and product evidence.
- **[Both]** prefer dual-domain sections over replacing one domain with another.

Never delete game examples while improving a skill. Move them to `[Game]` / `[游戏专用]` sections if they no longer fit the shared path.
# Skill Improve

Runs an improvement loop on a single skill:
test → fix → retest → keep or revert.

---

## Phase 1: Parse Argument

Read the skill name from the first argument. If missing, output usage and stop:

```
Usage: /skill-improve [skill-name]
Example: /skill-improve tech-debt
```

Verify `skills/[name]/SKILL.md` exists. If not, stop with:
"Skill '[name]' not found."

---

## Phase 2: Baseline Test

Run `/skill-test static [name]` and record the baseline score:
- Count of FAILs
- Count of WARNs
- Which current checks failed or warned (Check 1–8)

Display to the user:
```
Static baseline:   [N] failures, [M] warnings
Failing: Check 4 (no ask-before-write), Check 5 (no handoff)
```

If baseline is 0 FAILs and 0 WARNs, note it and proceed to Phase 2b.

### Phase 2b: Category Baseline

Look up the skill's `category:` field in
`skill_testing/catalog.yaml`.

If no `category:` field is found, display:
"Category: not yet assigned — skipping category checks."
and skip to Phase 3.

If category is found, run `/skill-test category [name]` and record the category baseline:
- Count of FAILs
- Count of WARNs
- Which specific category rubric metrics failed

Read the current category metrics in `skill_testing/quality-rubric.md`; match the
reported baseline to those actual metric owners before diagnosing a fix.

Display to the user:
```
Category baseline: [N] failures, [M] warnings  ([category] rubric)
```

If static/category have no findings, verify applicable existing spec assertions
and affected semantics before saying NO CHANGE. Structural scores alone do not
prove behavioral correctness; disclose unexecuted runtime cases and unavailable
required checks. Do not manufacture improvements or call a skill perfect.

---

## Phase 3: Diagnose

Read the full canonical skill file at `skills/[name]/SKILL.md`.

For each failing or warning **static** check, identify the exact gap:

- **Check 1 fail** → which frontmatter field is missing
- **Check 2 fail** → how many phases found vs. minimum required
- **Check 3 fail** → no verdict keywords anywhere in the skill body
- **Check 4 fail** → actual scoped-authority behavior is missing/contradictory;
  keyword absence alone is not a failure of a valid shared-contract implementation.
- **Check 5 warn** → no follow-up or next-step section at the end
- **Check 6 warn** → `context: fork` set but fewer than 5 phases found
- **Check 7 warn** → argument-hint is empty or doesn't match documented modes
- **Check 8 fail/warn** → actual required dual-domain behavior is missing/ambiguous.

For each failing or warning **category** check (if category was assigned in Phase 2b),
identify the exact gap in the skill's text. For example:
- If G2 fails (gate mode, full directors not spawned): skill body never references all 4
  PHASE-GATE director prompts
- If A2 fails: the authoring skill writes effects outside named authority or
  ignores actual unresolved choices/explicit per-section preferences. A valid
  named multi-section approval must not be failed for avoiding repeated questions.
- If T3 fails (team, BLOCKED not surfaced): skill doesn't halt dependent work on blocked agent

### Phase 3b: Dual-Domain Parity Diagnosis

Read the full skill, actual advertised scope and applicable owner bodies, using
`standards/technical-preferences.md` domain/capability evidence. Markers help
locate material but cannot establish parity or trigger invented feature scope.
Evaluate actual context, actions/output and handoff for Game and Product where
supported. Valid substantive behavior before line 50 is sufficient; preserve all
Game examples. Record real gaps and inaccessible/omitted required inputs rather
than treating keywords/line counts/last-line quotes as full-reading proof.

Record the diagnosis:

```markdown
Dual-domain parity:
- Game branch preserved: [PASS / FAIL]
- Product routing only: [YES / NO]
- Product context reads: [PASS / MISSING]
- Product steps/checks: [PASS / MISSING]
- Product output/next steps: [PASS / MISSING]
- Recommended fix: [add Product branch / expand Product output / update docs only]
```

Show the full combined diagnosis to the user before proposing any changes.

---

## Phase 4: Propose Fix

Write a targeted fix for each failure and warning. Show the proposed changes
as clearly marked before/after blocks. Only change what is failing — do not
rewrite sections that are passing.

For dual-domain parity fixes:
- Add Product sections beside existing Game content.
- Do not delete, shorten, or genericize game examples.
- Do not create a separate product-only slash command.
- Reuse existing Product paths: `design/cdd/`, `design/ux/`, `docs/architecture/`, `production/qa/`, `production/releases/`, `tests/`, and `docs/reference/<stack>/`.
- Prefer a focused additive patch over a broad rewrite.

Before writing, reuse exact canonical/adapter/rollback authority or ask once after
the concrete patch and full effect list. `--class skills` regenerates the entire
manifest skills class (all skill/resource projections), not only this skill.
Inspect the real supported generator check/plan for all changed paths, EXTRA/
INVALID and other-owner drift. EXTRA stops generation unless its exact object-list
removal has separate independent authority; internally recognized extras are not
human approval. Write only when every actual changed output effect
is covered and unrelated changes are excluded. Never invent a per-skill generator
flag/API or hand-edit adapters. With absent coverage, keep the candidate/draft and
request only the missing scope. Declined writes mean NO CHANGE.

---

## Phase 5: Write and Retest

Retain recoverable snapshots of the exact invocation baseline bytes/full hashes
for the canonical skill and every potentially changed adapter, manifest/generator
and necessary owner inputs.
Capture expected after identities for this writer's effects. Before applying,
confirm live inputs still equal the bound baseline; stop on other-author drift.

Write only covered canonical effects, then use the existing supported command
`python scripts/sync_adapters.py --write --class skills` only after the class-wide
plan/effect check above. Recheck all current eight static checks and assigned
category metrics against the same scope, plus affected existing spec/semantics.
Retests are writer checks, not independent review. Required independent review
uses a fresh exact baseline after edits; unavailable review remains pending.

Display the comparison:
```
Static:   Before [N] failures, [M] warnings  →  After [N'] failures, [M'] warnings
Category: Before [N] failures, [M] warnings  →  After [N'] failures, [M'] warnings  (if applicable)
Combined change: improved / no change / worse
```

---

## Phase 6: Verdict

Compare individual current checks and actual behavior, not only aggregate counts.
A lower FAIL/WARN count cannot hide any new required failure, lost Game/Product
behavior, authority gap or unresolved significant decision. Apply the six
`standards/notes-adr-sync.md` dispositions; Accepted decisions/scoped exceptions
are required before affected implementation. Continue independent work.

**IMPROVED:** verified intended gaps fixed with no new required regression and
selected workflow's required independent review satisfied. Disclose runtime
execution limits; a score gain alone does not establish IMPROVED.
**NO CHANGE:** no approved change, no verified improvement, or affected verification
still pending (state the retained candidate/live outcome precisely).

For a permitted rollback, first verify each live touched canonical/adapter equals
this invocation's exact after identity and manifest/generator context still
matches. Other-author changes stop affected restore; never overwrite them or use
`git checkout`. Reuse scoped rollback authority or ask only when absent. Restore
the exact retained invocation before bytes, and regenerate only covered class
effects after a fresh plan with no unrelated drift. Verify restored identities.
**REVERTED** means the exact covered restore actually succeeded. Preserve failed
candidate/evidence; rollback does not grant independent approval or completion.

---

## Phase 6b: Optional Improvement Evidence

After the keep/revert decision, reuse exact improvement-record authority; ask only
for missing/new report effects after displaying the record:

"May I write the improvement record to
`memory_bank/t3_archive/skill_testing/improvements/skill-improve-[name]-[YYYY-MM-DD].md`?"

Write only the covered record (or established fallback when Memory Bank is absent).
The record must include:
- Skill name and path
- Baseline static/category result
- Diagnosis summary
- Patch summary
- Retest static/category result
- Keep/revert decision
- Follow-up recommendation

Do not update `memory_bank/t3_archive/skill_testing/coverage-index.yaml` here.
That index is maintained by `/skill-test` when retest evidence is approved.

---

## Phase 7: Next Steps

- Run `/skill-test static all` to find the next skill with failures.
- Run `/skill-improve [next-name]` to continue the loop on another skill.
- Run `/skill-test audit` to see overall coverage progress in `memory_bank/t3_archive/skill_testing/coverage-index.yaml`.

Improvement evidence uses separately named report authority and exact before/
after dependencies; report-only/review-only never fixes inputs or updates coverage.
Memory Bank absence uses the established fallback without activation. `/skill-test`
owns separately authorized coverage updates; include no implicit index/state effect.

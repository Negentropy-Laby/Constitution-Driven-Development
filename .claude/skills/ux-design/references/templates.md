# UX Document Skeletons

> Loaded on demand from `ux-design/SKILL.md`. Follow these requirements as part of the parent skill; do not treat this file as a separately invocable skill.

## 3. Create File Skeleton

Once the user confirms, **immediately** create the output file with empty section
headers. This ensures incremental writes have a target and work survives interruptions.

Ask: "May I create the skeleton file at `design/ux/[filename].md`?"

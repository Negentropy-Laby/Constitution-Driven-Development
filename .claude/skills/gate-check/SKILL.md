## QA policy, facts and authority

Apply `standards/evidence-lifecycle.md`, `standards/notes-adr-sync.md` and existing
collaboration authority. Read actual `workflow/workflow-catalog.yaml`, domain,
current transition and established project QA scope, including initialized
`memory_bank/t1_axioms/qa_context.md` or the existing owning Story/plan/decision.
QA orchestration is optional by default; strict obligations need explicit source,
authority and exact checks/scope. Review mode does not select strict QA. Absent
optional Memory Bank/QA Context with no actual strict selection uses the catalog's
default optional orchestration; disclose absence without requiring initialization.
Unknown applies to unresolved actual required applicability or conflicting policy,
not optional context absence. Resolve that affected scope before dependent claims;
Honor actual user-specified per-effect approval conditions when determining coverage;
do not invent strict obligations or passing results.
Optional orchestration never waives required Story AC, governing DoD, decisions,
evidence or required review. Type tables are starting points; actual owners decide
requirements. Each required check retains PASS/FAIL/NotRun/Blocked/Pending; N/A
needs a governing applicability reason and cannot erase a failure.

Separate sufficiency, actual execution, independence, acceptance and completion.
Files/keywords/counts, planning cases and self-checks prove none of the other facts.
Read relied-on bodies and minimum required direct/indirect dependency closure;
retain full SHA-256/byte sizes, recoverable originals and original-path witnesses.
Disclose reading omissions. Exact bound historical results may be reused only
where selected workflow permits, labeled historical with original runtime/observer,
inputs and scope; never call them this run's execution. Missing required originals
or observations leave affected checks incomplete. Risk acceptance is a separate
scoped record; it cannot change FAIL/NotRun/Blocked/Pending to PASS or completion.

Reuse named paths/effects authority across roles/retries; before new authority show
draft and complete effect set, asking only for material new scope. Review-only
invokes no write entrypoint. Report-only writes its new report, excluding inputs,
indexes, session/sprint/stage state and closure. Existing report paths require a
new revision with prior evidence preserved; index effects need their own covered
scope and historical links. Optional Memory Bank absence uses Story/report/
conversation fallback without initialization, publication or activation.

## User Guide

- When to use: Validate readiness to advance between development phases. Produces a PASS/CONCERNS/FAIL verdict with specific blockers and required artifacts. Supports both game and general product domains — auto-detects domain from the concept document.
- Inputs: Command arguments: `/gate-check [target-phase] [--review full|lean|solo]. Game phases: systems-design | technical-setup | pre-production | production | polish | release. Product phases: specification | architecture | pre-implementation | implementation | verification | release`; project artifacts referenced below; user decisions and approvals before writes.
- Outputs: Primary artifacts, reports, or conversation guidance described below; write files only after user approval.
- Memory-bank writes: Only when Memory Bank is initialized and each named write effect is covered: `memory_bank/t0_core/current_state.md`, `memory_bank/t3_archive/gate_runs/`, `memory_bank/t3_archive/gate_runs/gate-[phase]-[YYYY-MM-DD].md`.
- Next steps: Follow the workflow hand-off or next-step guidance below; recommendations do not auto-run and require explicit user command/approval.

# Phase Gate Validation

This skill validates whether the project is ready to advance to the next development
phase. It checks for required artifacts, quality standards, and blockers.

**Distinct from `/project-stage-detect`**: That skill is diagnostic ("where are we?").
This skill is prescriptive ("are we ready to advance?" with a formal verdict).

**Domain detection.** The concept document at `design/cdd/` reveals the domain:
- **游戏专用**: `game-concept.md` exists — game stage names and game-specific checks
- **通用产品**: `product-concept.md` exists — product stage names and product-specific checks

Sections below are marked **[通用场景]** (both domains), **[游戏专用]** (game-domain), or **[通用产品]** (product-domain).

## Production Stages (7)

**[通用场景]** The project progresses through these stages. Stage names vary by domain:

**[游戏专用]** Game stages:
1. **Concept** — Brainstorming, game concept document
2. **Systems Design** — Mapping systems, writing CDDs
3. **Technical Setup** — Engine config, architecture decisions
4. **Pre-Production** — Prototyping, vertical slice validation
5. **Production** — Feature development
6. **Polish** — Performance, playtesting, bug fixing
7. **Release** — Launch prep, certification

**[通用产品]** Product stages:
1. **Concept** — Ideation, product concept document, constitution
2. **Specification** — Mapping modules, writing CDDs
3. **Architecture** — Stack config, architecture decisions
4. **Pre-Implementation** — Prototyping, user validation
5. **Implementation** — Feature development
6. **Verification** — Performance, user testing, bug fixing
7. **Release** — Launch prep, deployment validation

**Gate policy**: governed advisory. The gate must run before normal
advancement; PASS may update `production/stage.txt` after user confirmation,
CONCERNS may update it only with a recorded risk note, and FAIL does not update
it unless the user explicitly overrides with a risk note.

**Required source of truth**: `workflow/workflow-catalog.yaml` is the only
source for normal-progression blockers. A `required: true` catalog step can be a
missing-artifact blocker. Optional steps, later-phase steps, and
`required_when` steps outside the active gate can only appear as CONCERNS or
follow-up actions unless a quality failure directly invalidates the current
phase goal.

**Boundary clarifications**:
- [Game] `design/art/art-bible.md` is a Concept optional artifact, not a
  Technical Setup blocker.
- [Product] `design/ux/interaction-patterns.md` is a Pre-Production
  `required_when` artifact, not an Architecture blocker.
- [Product] `design/ux/surface-profile.md` records N/A decisions for product
  surface artifacts when applicability is ambiguous.
- `/qa-plan` is optional during Production by default; missing QA plans or
  `/team-qa` sign-off become release-readiness concerns unless the project has
  explicitly opted into strict QA.
- [Product] one user-test/workflow validation is required before
  Implementation; three cumulative product validation sessions are required
  before Release during Polish / Verification.

## 1. Parse Arguments

**Target phase:** `$ARGUMENTS[0]` (blank = auto-detect current stage, then validate next transition)

Also resolve the review mode (once, store for all gate spawns this run):
1. If `--review` is present, require its nonempty value to be exactly
   `full`, `lean` or `solo`; use the valid explicit value.
2. Otherwise, if `production/review-mode.txt` exists, read and trim its value;
   require exactly `full`, `lean` or `solo`, then use that valid global value.
3. Only when both override and global file are absent default to `lean`.

Resolve once and reuse the same valid mode for all applicable director spawns.
Empty/invalid explicit values or an existing empty/invalid global file stop mode
resolution before any director spawn, gate-skip verdict or status/closure write.
Report the actual invalid source/value and request correction; do not silently
fall back to lean or invent a completed gate. Preserve existing legal CLI/modes.

Note: in `solo` mode, director spawns (CD-PHASE-GATE, TD-PHASE-GATE, PR-PHASE-GATE, AD-PHASE-GATE) are explicitly skipped; required substantive quality/evidence still applies. Skips establish no independence/approval. In `lean` mode, all four directors still run (phase gates are the purpose of lean mode).

- **With argument**: `/gate-check production` — validate readiness for that specific phase. Supports both game phase names (systems-design, technical-setup, pre-production, production, polish, release) and product phase names (specification, architecture, pre-implementation, implementation, verification, release). The skill auto-detects the domain from the concept document at `design/cdd/`.
- **No argument**: Auto-detect current stage using the same heuristics as
  `/project-stage-detect`, then **confirm with the user before running**:

  Use `AskUserQuestion`:
  - Prompt: "Detected stage: **[current stage]** ([domain]). Running gate for [Current] → [Next] transition. Is this correct?"
  - Options:
    - `[A] Yes — run this gate`
    - `[B] No — pick a different gate` (if selected, show a second widget listing all gate options appropriate to the detected domain: [游戏专用] Concept → Systems Design, Systems Design → Technical Setup, Technical Setup → Pre-Production, Pre-Production → Production, Production → Polish, Polish → Release. [通用产品] Concept → Specification, Specification → Architecture, Architecture → Pre-Implementation, Pre-Implementation → Implementation, Implementation → Verification, Verification → Release)

  Do not skip this confirmation step when no argument is provided.

---

## 2. Phase Gate Definitions

Resolve actual domain/transition and catalog applicability, then read that transition in [gate definitions](references/gate-definitions.md). Catalog owns normal-progression artifact requirements; reference owns applicable substantive quality/risk checks. Follow required direct/indirect evidence without expanding to every directory or treating optional/later-phase artifacts as universal blockers.

## 3. Run the Gate Check

**Before running artifact checks**, read `docs/consistency-failures.md` if it exists.
Extract entries whose Domain matches the target phase (e.g., if checking
Systems Design → Technical Setup, pull entries in Economy, Combat, or any CDD domain;
if checking Technical Setup → Pre-Production, pull entries in Architecture, Engine).
Carry these as context — recurring conflict patterns in the target domain warrant
increased scrutiny on those specific checks.

Then read `workflow/generated/gate-required-artifacts.md` and select the
section matching the target transition and detected domain. Treat that generated
section as the authoritative Required Artifacts / Required Step Evidence list.

For each item in the target gate:

### Artifact Checks
- Use `Glob` and `Read` to verify files exist and have meaningful content
- Don't just check existence — verify the file has real content (not just a template header)
- Directory/file counts locate evidence; read substantive implementation/closure/results. Counts cannot prove capability, three actual sessions or product qualification.

**Systems Design → Technical Setup gate — cross-CDD review check**:
Use `Glob('design/cdd/cross-review-*.md')` to find the `/review-all-gdds` report.
If no file matches, mark the "cross-CDD review report exists" artifact as **FAIL** and
surface it prominently: "No `/review-all-gdds` report found in `design/cdd/`. Run
`/review-all-gdds` before advancing to Technical Setup."
If a file is found, read it and check the verdict line: a FAIL verdict means the
cross-CDD consistency check failed and must be resolved before advancing.

### Quality Checks
- For test checks: Run the test suite via `Bash` if a test runner is configured
- For design review: resolve actual DocKind/owner under `design/INSTRUCTIONS.md` and read substantive required bodies/valid aliases; headings alone do not PASS
- For performance checks: `Read` `standards/technical-preferences.md` and compare against any
  profiling data in `tests/performance/` or recent `/perf-profile` output
- For localization checks: `Grep` for hardcoded strings in `src/`

### Cross-Reference Checks
- Compare `design/cdd/` documents against `src/` implementations
- Check that every system referenced in architecture docs has corresponding code
- Verify sprint plans reference real work items

---

## 4. Collaborative Assessment

For items that can't be automatically verified, **ask the user**:

- "I can't automatically verify that the core loop plays well. Has it been playtested?"
- "No playtest report found. Has informal testing been done?"
- "Performance profiling data isn't available. Would you like to run `/perf-profile`?"

**Never assume PASS for unverifiable items.** Retain actual NotRun/Blocked/Pending/Unknown (MANUAL CHECK NEEDED is a display hint). Required incomplete checks prevent PASS: gate FAIL indicates unmet normal readiness, not an invented executed test failure. Optional follow-up may be CONCERNS.

---

## 4b. Director Panel Assessment

Before generating the final verdict, spawn all four directors as **parallel subagents** via Task using the parallel gate protocol from `standards/director-gates.md`. Issue all four Task calls simultaneously — do not wait for one before starting the next.

**Spawn in parallel:**

1. **`creative-director`** — gate **CD-PHASE-GATE** (`standards/director-gates.md`)
2. **`technical-director`** — gate **TD-PHASE-GATE** (`standards/director-gates.md`)
3. **`producer`** — gate **PR-PHASE-GATE** (`standards/director-gates.md`)
4. **`art-director`** — gate **AD-PHASE-GATE** (`standards/director-gates.md`)
   **[通用产品]** skip if the project has no visual/UI component — CLI tools and backend services may not benefit from art director review

Pass to each: target phase name, list of artifacts present, and the context fields listed in that gate's definition.

**Collect all four responses, then present the Director Panel summary:**

```
## Director Panel Assessment

Creative Director:  [READY / CONCERNS / NOT READY]
  [feedback]

Technical Director: [READY / CONCERNS / NOT READY]
  [feedback]

Producer:           [READY / CONCERNS / NOT READY]
  [feedback]

Art Director:       [READY / CONCERNS / NOT READY]
  [feedback]
```

**Apply to the verdict:**
- Any director returns NOT READY → verdict is minimum FAIL (user may override with explicit acknowledgement)
- Any director returns CONCERNS → verdict is minimum CONCERNS
- All four READY → eligible for PASS (still subject to artifact and quality checks from Section 3)

---

## 5. Output the Verdict

```
## Gate Check: [Current Phase] → [Target Phase]

**Date**: [date]
**Checked by**: gate-check skill

### Required Artifacts: [X/Y present]
- [x] design/cdd/game-concept.md — exists, 2.4KB
- [ ] docs/architecture/ — MISSING (no ADRs found)
- [x] production/sprints/ — exists, 1 sprint plan

### Quality Checks: [X/Y passing]
- [x] CDD has 8/8 required sections
- [ ] Tests — FAILED (3 failures in tests/unit/)
- [?] Core loop playtested — MANUAL CHECK NEEDED

### Blockers
1. **No Architecture Decision Records** — Run `/architecture-decision` to create one
   covering core system architecture before entering production.
2. **3 test failures** — Fix failing tests in tests/unit/ before advancing.

### Recommendations
- [Priority actions to resolve blockers]
- [Optional improvements that aren't blocking]

### Verdict: [PASS / CONCERNS / FAIL]
- **PASS**: All required artifacts present, all quality checks passing; normal stage update allowed after user confirmation
- **CONCERNS**: Minor gaps exist but can be addressed during the next phase; stage update allowed only with a risk note
- **FAIL**: Critical blockers exist; no stage update unless the user explicitly overrides with a risk note
```

---

## 5a. Chain-of-Verification

After drafting the verdict in Phase 5, challenge it before finalising.

**Step 1 — Generate 5 challenge questions** designed to disprove the verdict:

For a **PASS** draft:
- "Which quality checks did I verify by actually reading a file, vs. inferring they passed?"
- "Are there MANUAL CHECK NEEDED items I marked PASS without user confirmation?"
- "Did I confirm all listed artifacts have real content, not just empty headers?"
- "Could any blocker I dismissed as minor actually prevent the phase from succeeding?"
- "Which single check am I least confident in, and why?"

For a **CONCERNS** draft:
- "Could any listed CONCERN be elevated to a blocker given the project's current state?"
- "Is the concern resolvable within the next phase, or does it compound over time?"
- "Did I soften any FAIL condition into a CONCERN to avoid a harder verdict?"
- "Are there artifacts I didn't check that could reveal additional blockers?"
- "Do all the CONCERNS together create a blocking problem even if each is minor alone?"

For a **FAIL** draft:
- "Have I accurately separated hard blockers from strong recommendations?"
- "Are there any PASS items I was too lenient about?"
- "Am I missing any additional blockers the user should know about?"
- "Can I provide a minimal path to PASS — the specific 3 things that must change?"
- "Is the fail condition resolvable, or does it indicate a deeper design problem?"

**Step 2 — Answer each question** as author self-check, not independent review.
Do NOT reference the draft verdict text — re-check specific files or ask the user.

**Step 3 — Revise if needed:**
- If any answer reveals a missed blocker → upgrade verdict (PASS→CONCERNS or CONCERNS→FAIL)
- If any answer reveals an over-stated blocker → downgrade only if citing specific evidence
- If answers are consistent → confirm verdict unchanged

**Step 4 — Note the verification** in the final report output:
`Chain-of-Verification: [N] questions checked — verdict [unchanged | revised from X to Y]`

---

## 6. Update Stage Under Governed Advisory Policy

When the verdict is **PASS** and the user confirms they want to advance:

1. Write the new stage name to `production/stage.txt` (single line, no trailing newline)
2. This immediately updates the status line for all future sessions

Example: if passing the "Pre-Production → Production" gate:
```bash
echo -n "Production" > production/stage.txt
```

**Use covered stage-write authority**: check existing authorization for the exact `production/stage.txt` transition/effect. Continue when covered; only if missing or materially new ask: "Gate passed. May I update `production/stage.txt` to 'Production'?"

When the verdict is **CONCERNS**:

1. Ask whether the user wants to advance with acknowledged risk.
2. If yes verify separate risk/report and transition path/effect authority; record exact scope/inputs/actor/time and unchanged CONCERNS before any covered stage write.
3. If no, leave `production/stage.txt` unchanged and list the smallest remediation path.

When the verdict is **FAIL**:

1. Leave `production/stage.txt` unchanged by default.
2. Ask whether the user wants to override the FAIL verdict.
3. A separately authorized governance override may change the named stage projection only where existing governance permits. Bind actor/authority/time/scope/inputs/exclusions/risks and covered report/state effects. Preserve FAIL and actual failed/unexecuted checks; create no PASS, Story closure, ADR acceptance or runtime/Product qualification.
4. If the user does not override, leave `production/stage.txt` unchanged and list the blockers.

### Memory Bank Audit Record

After presenting the verdict, reuse existing authorization for the exact new audit record path/effect. Only if missing or materially new ask:

`May I write this gate result to memory_bank/t3_archive/gate_runs/gate-[phase]-[YYYY-MM-DD].md?`

When `memory_bank/` exists and that exact record effect is authorized, write a T3 audit record under
`memory_bank/t3_archive/gate_runs/`.

- Use `gate-[phase]-[YYYY-MM-DD].md`.
- If that file exists, use `gate-[phase]-[YYYY-MM-DD]-[NN].md`.
- Include gate name, domain, date, verdict, required artifact source,
  missing artifacts, quality concerns, director panel summary,
  Chain-of-Verification result, stage update decision, and any override or risk
  note.
- The required artifact source is
  `workflow/generated/gate-required-artifacts.md`.

When an authorized transition updates `production/stage.txt`, update
`memory_bank/t0_core/current_state.md` only when initialized and that separate
pointer effect is covered in the named transition set. The current
state update should record current phase, stage source, latest gate evidence
path, current blocker, next command, and any risk/override note.

If `memory_bank/` does not exist, do not create it from `/gate-check`. Keep the
existing `production/stage.txt` behavior and say: "Run `/constitute` to
establish the memory_bank governance control plane."

---

## 7. Closing Next-Step Widget

After the verdict is presented and any stage.txt update is complete, close with a structured next-step prompt using `AskUserQuestion`.

**Tailor the options to the gate that just ran:**

For **systems-design PASS**:
```
Gate passed. What would you like to do next?
[A] Run /create-architecture — produce your master architecture blueprint and ADR work plan (recommended next step)
[B] Design more CDDs first — return here when all MVP systems are complete
[C] Stop here for this session
```

> **Note for systems-design PASS**: `/create-architecture` is the required next step before writing any ADRs. It produces the master architecture document and a prioritized list of ADRs to write. Running `/architecture-decision` without this step means writing ADRs without a blueprint — skip it at your own risk.

For **technical-setup PASS**:
```
Gate passed. What would you like to do next?
[A] Start Pre-Production — begin prototyping the Vertical Slice
[B] Write more ADRs first — run /architecture-decision [next-system]
[C] Stop here for this session
```

For all other gates, offer the two most logical next steps for that phase plus "Stop here".

---

- **No deployment strategy?** -> Document deployment and rollback plan.
- **Missing database migrations?** -> Run migrations against a fresh instance.
- **Integration contracts undefined?** -> `/architecture-decision [integration-name]`.
- **Ready for release?** -> `/launch-checklist`.

## Collaborative Protocol

This skill follows the collaborative design principle:

1. **Scan first**: Check all artifacts and quality gates
2. **Ask about unknowns**: Don't assume PASS for things you can't verify
3. **Present findings**: Show the full checklist with status
4. **User decides**: The verdict guides the stage decision; user override is allowed only when risks are recorded
5. **Resolve write authority**: reuse a covered named report changeset; for missing/new report paths/effects ask "May I write this gate check report to [exact production/gate-checks/ path]?". Report authority does not cover stage/audit/index effects.

Do not silently advance on CONCERNS or FAIL. Document the risks, capture an
explicit override when needed, and leave `production/stage.txt` unchanged unless
the governed advisory policy allows the stage update.

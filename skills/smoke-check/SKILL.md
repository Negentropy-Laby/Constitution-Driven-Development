## QA policy, facts and authority

Apply `standards/evidence-lifecycle.md`, `standards/notes-adr-sync.md` and existing
collaboration authority. Read actual `workflow/workflow-catalog.yaml`, domain,
current transition and established project QA scope, including initialized
`memory_bank/t1_axioms/qa_context.md` or the existing owning Story/plan/decision.
QA orchestration is optional by default; strict obligations need explicit source,
authority and exact checks/scope. Review mode does not select strict QA. Absent
optional Memory Bank/QA Context with no actual strict selection uses the catalog's
default optional orchestration; disclose absence without requiring initialization.
Unknown applies to unresolved actual required applicability or conflicting policy,
not optional context absence. Resolve that affected scope before dependent claims;
Honor actual user-specified per-effect approval conditions when determining coverage;
do not invent strict obligations or passing results.
Optional orchestration never waives required Story AC, governing DoD, decisions,
evidence or required review. Type tables are starting points; actual owners decide
requirements. Each required check retains PASS/FAIL/NotRun/Blocked/Pending; N/A
needs a governing applicability reason and cannot erase a failure.

Separate sufficiency, actual execution, independence, acceptance and completion.
Files/keywords/counts, planning cases and self-checks prove none of the other facts.
Read relied-on bodies and minimum required direct/indirect dependency closure;
retain full SHA-256/byte sizes, recoverable originals and original-path witnesses.
Disclose reading omissions. Exact bound historical results may be reused only
where selected workflow permits, labeled historical with original runtime/observer,
inputs and scope; never call them this run's execution. Missing required originals
or observations leave affected checks incomplete. Risk acceptance is a separate
scoped record; it cannot change FAIL/NotRun/Blocked/Pending to PASS or completion.

Reuse named paths/effects authority across roles/retries; before new authority show
draft and complete effect set, asking only for material new scope. Review-only
invokes no write entrypoint. Report-only writes its new report, excluding inputs,
indexes, session/sprint/stage state and closure. Existing report paths require a
new revision with prior evidence preserved; index effects need their own covered
scope and historical links. Optional Memory Bank absence uses Story/report/
conversation fallback without initialization, publication or activation.

## User Guide

- When to use: Run the critical path smoke test gate before QA hand-off. Executes the automated test suite, verifies core functionality, and produces a PASS/FAIL report. Supports both game and product projects. A failed smoke check means the build is not ready for QA.
- Inputs: Command arguments: `/smoke-check [sprint | quick | --platform pc|console|mobile|web|api|cli|all]`; project artifacts referenced below; user decisions and approvals before writes.
- Outputs: Primary artifacts, reports, or conversation guidance described below; write files only after user approval.
- Memory-bank writes: Only when Memory Bank is initialized and each named write effect is covered: `memory_bank/t3_archive/qa_evidence_index.md`.
- Next steps: Follow the workflow hand-off or next-step guidance below; recommendations do not auto-run and require explicit user command/approval.

# Smoke Check

This skill is the gate between "implementation done" and "ready for QA
hand-off". It runs the automated test suite, checks for test coverage gaps,
batch-verifies critical paths with the developer, and produces a PASS/FAIL
report.

The rule is simple: **a build that fails smoke check does not go to QA.**
Handing a broken build to QA wastes their time and demoralises the team.

**Output:** `production/qa/smoke-[date].md`

## Dual-Domain Parity Contract

| Area | Game branch | Product branch |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| Context reads | Engine from technical preferences, current QA plan, sprint stories, smoke tests, test directories, recent build/test output | Language/framework from technical preferences, current QA plan, API/CLI/workflow/deployment smoke tests, sprint stories, CI/test output, package/deploy config |
| Steps | Run engine tests, verify playable critical path, validate platform/input batches, confirm build ready for QA | Run product test command, verify API/CLI/web/core workflow batches, validate migration/config/deployment/package smoke checks, confirm release candidate ready for QA |
| Outputs | `production/qa/smoke-[date].md` with PASS/FAIL, failed tests, platform batches, manual checks, QA hand-off decision | `production/qa/smoke-[date].md` with PASS/FAIL, contract/CLI/workflow/migration/deployment smoke results, manual checks, QA hand-off decision |
| Next steps | Fix blockers or run `/team-qa`; update regression suite for failures | Fix blockers or run `/team-qa`; run `/test-evidence-review` for contract/migration/package evidence and `/release-checklist` when release-bound |

---

## Parse Arguments

Arguments can be combined: `/smoke-check sprint --platform console`

**Base mode** (first argument, default: `sprint`):
- `sprint` — full smoke check against the current sprint's stories
- `quick` — skip coverage scan (Phase 3) and Batch 3; use for rapid re-checks

**Platform flag** (`--platform`, default: none):

**[游戏专用]** Game platforms:
- `--platform pc` — PC checks (keyboard, mouse, windowed mode)
- `--platform console` — console checks (gamepad, TV safe zones, certification)
- `--platform mobile` — mobile checks (touch, portrait/landscape, battery/thermal)

**[通用产品]** Product platforms:
- `--platform web` — browser checks (page load, navigation, form submission)
- `--platform api` — API checks (health endpoint, auth flow, response schema)
- `--platform cli` — CLI checks (help output, core command, config loading)

**[通用场景]** `--platform all` — all applicable platform variants; per-platform verdict

If `--platform` is provided, Phase 4 adds platform-specific batches and
Phase 5 outputs a per-platform verdict table in addition to the overall verdict.

---

## Phase 1: Detect Test Setup

Before running anything, understand the environment:

1. **Test configuration/capability check**: read actual project test configuration,
   pinned tooling, test roots and documented commands (including configured tests
   outside `tests/`). Verify the configured runner and execution environment are
   already available. `tests/` is a conventional example, not a prerequisite.
   Do not scaffold/stop solely because that directory is absent when valid tests
   live elsewhere. If a required configuration/runner/input is absent, record the
   affected execution as NotRun with its actual missing dependency (Blocked if
   setup prevents it), disclose INCOMPLETE hand-off and suggest the scoped
   `/test-setup` remedy when applicable. Continue independent available checks;
   do not invent observed FAIL/PASS, fetch/install or initialize anything.

2. **CI check**: check whether `.github/workflows/` contains a workflow file
   referencing tests. Note in the report whether CI is configured.

3. **Technology detection**: read actual configured commands/pinned tooling plus
   `standards/technical-preferences.md`. Record Game Engine or Product
   Language/Framework when declared, and bind the actual config/runner/command,
   test roots, relevant inputs and available capability before execution. Language
   examples below apply only when confirmed by that project's real configuration;
   a language name or unknown JavaScript framework cannot select a test command.

4. **Smoke test list**: check whether `production/qa/smoke-tests.md` or
   `tests/smoke/` exists. If a smoke test list is found, load it for use in
   Phase 4. If neither exists, smoke tests will be drawn from the current QA
   plan (Phase 4 fallback).

5. **QA plan check**: resolve the actual current sprint/feature, Story set,
   domain and requested platform/build scope from the user and owning project
   records. Honor an explicitly named plan only after directly reading its body
   and checking that scope. Otherwise glob `production/qa/qa-plan-*.md`, read
   candidate bodies and their referenced scope owners, and select a plan that
   covers this run. A filename, date or newest mtime does not establish a match.
   If multiple matching candidates remain or their scope is ambiguous, present
   their actual existing paths and scope differences with `AskUserQuestion`;
   do not invent a path or silently choose one. Keep plan-dependent claims
   pending until resolved; continue independent available checks.
   Bind the selected original path, full SHA-256, byte size, collection time
   and matched scope for Phase 3, Phase 4, the report and QA hand-off.
   If no usable matching plan exists, disclose the actual absence/mismatch or
   read failure and use available scoped Story/smoke inputs for independent
   checks. Suggest `/qa-plan` for that actual scope without running it. Missing
   optional planning does not invent a strict gate; a plan required by the
   selected workflow remains incomplete. Never fabricate a hand-off plan.

Report findings before proceeding: "Environment: [technology] | Domain: [game/product]. Test directory:
[found / not found]. CI configured: [yes / no]. QA plan: [path / not found]."

---

## Phase 2: Run Automated Tests

Run only the actual configured test command through an available appropriate
shell/runtime verified in Phase 1. The examples below are conditional references:
use one only if the actual project config selects that runner/arguments and the
runner is already available. Respect valid configured roots outside `tests/`.
Never guess a command from language, add unsupported flags, install/fetch a runner
or infer current execution from an artifact filename. Missing required setup or
capability stays NotRun/Blocked and INCOMPLETE for affected hand-off.

**[游戏专用] Godot 4:**
```bash
godot --headless --script tests/gdunit4_runner.gd 2>&1
```
Only if actual configured GDUnit4 uses this alternate runner path and it exists:
```bash
godot --headless -s addons/gdunit4/GdUnitRunner.gd 2>&1
```
If neither path exists, note: "GDUnit4 runner not found — confirm the runner
path for your test framework."

**[游戏专用] Unity:**
Use the configured available Unity editor/CI runner if supported. If it cannot
execute here, record current NotRun and inspect permitted prior result artifacts:
```bash
ls -t test-results/ 2>&1 | head -5
```
If XML/JSON results exist, inspect exact originals and matching build/test/config scope, runtime/observer and result. A latest file/mtime is insufficient; label permitted prior results historical, not current execution. If no artifacts exist: "Unity tests must be run from the
editor or CI pipeline. Supply exact-bound originals for permitted historical reuse; a verbal confirmation does not change current NotRun."

**[游戏专用] Unreal Engine:**
```bash
ls -t Saved/Logs/ 2>&1 | grep -i "test\|automation" | head -5
```
If no matching log found: "UE automation tests must be run via the Session
Frontend or CI pipeline. Current execution remains NotRun; exact-bound originals are needed for permitted historical reuse."

**[通用产品] Python / pytest:**
```bash
pytest -x --tb=short 2>&1
```

**[通用产品] TypeScript / JavaScript:**
If a Vitest config exists (`vitest.config.*`), run:
```bash
npx --no-install vitest run 2>&1
```
If a Jest config exists (`jest.config.*` or `package.json` test script clearly
uses Jest), run:
```bash
npx --no-install jest 2>&1
```
If neither runner is selected by actual configuration, do not guess
`npm test -- --runInBand`. Read the real package test script/runner requirements;
run only its verified configured command when available. Otherwise record
NotRun/Blocked with the missing configuration/capability and retain INCOMPLETE
for required checks.

**[通用产品] Rust / cargo test:**
```bash
cargo test 2>&1
```

**[通用产品] Go / go test:**
```bash
go test ./... 2>&1
```

**Unknown technology / no configured command:**
Inspect actual project configuration independently of the preferences declaration.
A valid configured command may still run when the language label is absent. If
required execution configuration remains unknown/unavailable, record NotRun with
actual missing scope; request the needed project configuration or suggest the
applicable setup skill. Do not guess a language/runner or emit an observed FAIL.

**If the runner is unavailable**, record local execution NotRun with reason.
It is neither observed FAIL nor PASS WITH WARNINGS. Required unexecuted/unavailable/
pending smoke checks make hand-off INCOMPLETE; optional checks remain disclosed
follow-up. Actual documented manual results do not relabel unexecuted automation.
Permitted historical IDE/CI output needs exact original build/test/config input
identity, runtime, observer and recoverable result; label it historical separately.
An unbound verbal "tests passed" cannot satisfy required automation.

Parse runner output and extract:
- Total tests run
- Passing count
- Failing count
- Names of any failing tests (up to 10; if more, note the count)
- Any crash or error output from the runner itself

---

## Phase 3: Check Test Coverage

Draw the story list from, in priority order:
1. The scope-matched QA plan selected in Phase 1 (its Test Summary table lists expected test
   file paths per story)
2. The actual current scope-matched sprint plan from `production/sprints/`,
   verified against the owning Story set rather than newest mtime
3. If the `quick` argument was passed, skip this phase entirely and note:
   "Coverage scan skipped — run `/smoke-check sprint` for full coverage
   analysis."

For each story in scope:

1. Extract the system slug from the story's file path
   (e.g., `production/epics/combat/story-001.md` → `combat`)
2. Glob `tests/unit/[system]/` and `tests/integration/[system]/` for files
   whose name contains the story slug or a closely related term
3. Check the story file itself for a `Test file:` header field or a
   "Test Evidence" section

Assign a coverage status to each story:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **COVERED** | Read behavioral oracle covers actual required AC; execution is separate |
| **MANUAL** | Story type is Visual/Feel or UI; a test evidence document was found |
| **MISSING** | Actual required evidence/test absent for the Game/Product Story |
| **EXPECTED** | Actual owner permits manual/spot-check; required observations still need evidence |
| **UNKNOWN** | Story file missing or unreadable |

Resolve MISSING against actual Story/DoD and selected scope: required gaps make affected hand-off/closure incomplete; optional extra coverage is advisory. Filenames, percentages and keywords cannot establish coverage or execution.

---

## Phase 4: Run Manual Smoke Check

Domain detection drives which batches to use:
- [Game] detected -> present Game smoke batches (Batch 1-3, platform batches pc/console/mobile)
- [Product] detected -> present Product smoke batches (Batch 1-3, platform batches web/api/cli)
- Unknown -> present generic stability checks (never default to game batches)

Draw the smoke test checklist from, in priority order:
1. The selected QA plan's "Smoke Test Scope" section (if its actual scope was verified in Phase 1)
2. `production/qa/smoke-tests.md` (if it exists)
3. `tests/smoke/` directory contents (if it exists)
4. The standard fallback list below (used only when none of the above exist)

Tailor batches 2 and 3 to the actual systems identified from the sprint or QA
plan. Replace bracketed placeholders with real mechanic or workflow names from
the current sprint's stories.

Collect actual results with `AskUserQuestion`. For every applicable item offer PASS / FAIL / NotRun / Blocked / Pending; N/A needs a scope reason. Examples below are prompts, never prefilled results. Record observer, actual steps/time, build/input identity and result. Split batches rather than omit required checks.

## Phase 5: Generate Report

Assemble the full smoke check report:

````markdown
## Smoke Check Report
**Date**: [date]
**Sprint**: [sprint name / number, or "Not identified"]
**Technology**: [engine or stack]
**QA Plan**: [verified actual scope-matched path, or "Not found / scope mismatch / candidate choice pending"]
**QA Plan Binding**: [full SHA-256, bytes, collection time and matched scope; unavailable facts stay explicit]
**Argument**: [sprint | quick | blank]

---

### Automated Tests

**Status**: [PASS ([N] tests, [N] passing) | FAIL ([N] failures) |
NOT RUN ([reason])]

[If FAIL, list failing tests:]
- `[test name]` — [brief failure description from runner output]

[If NOT RUN:]
"Current automated execution is NotRun: [reason]. For permitted historical
reuse, provide recoverable original IDE/CI output bound to exact build/test/config
inputs, scope, runtime and observer. Record historical outcome separately; a bare
"yes" or "tests passed" is insufficient and does not change current NotRun.
Required missing execution/evidence yields INCOMPLETE, not an observed FAIL."

---

### Test Coverage

| Story | Type | Test File | Coverage Status |
|-------|------|-----------|----------------|
| [title] | Logic | `tests/unit/[system]/[slug]_test.[ext]` | COVERED |
| [title] | Visual/Feel | `production/qa/evidence/manual/[slug]-screenshots.md` | MANUAL |
| [title] | Logic | — | MISSING ⚠ |
| [title] | Config/Data | — | EXPECTED |

**Summary**: [N] covered, [N] manual, [N] missing, [N] expected.

---

### Manual Smoke Checks

Record the checks that were actually presented for the detected domain.

**[游戏专用] Example rows:**
- [x] Game launches without crash — PASS
- [x] New game starts — PASS
- [x] [Core mechanic] — PASS
- [x] Save / load — PASS

**[通用产品] Example rows:**
- [x] API health endpoint returns 200 — PASS
- [x] CLI `--help` prints usage — PASS
- [x] Web homepage loads without console errors — PASS
- [x] Core workflow produces expected result — PASS
- [x] Database migrations run cleanly — PASS

**[通用场景] Failure row format:**
- [ ] [check name] — FAIL: [user's description]

---

### Missing Test Evidence

Stories that must have test evidence before they can be marked COMPLETE via
`/story-done`:

- **[story title]** (`[path]`) — Logic story has no test file.
  Expected location: `tests/unit/[system]/[story-slug]_test.[ext]`

[If none:] "All Logic and Integration stories have test coverage."

---

### Platform-Specific Results *(only if `--platform` was provided)*

| Platform | Checks Run | Passed | Failed | Platform Verdict |
|----------|-----------|--------|--------|-----------------|
| PC | [N] | [N] | [N] | PASS / FAIL / NotRun / Blocked / Pending |
| Console | [N] | [N] | [N] | PASS / FAIL / NotRun / Blocked / Pending |
| Mobile | [N] | [N] | [N] | PASS / FAIL / NotRun / Blocked / Pending |
| Web | [N] | [N] | [N] | PASS / FAIL / NotRun / Blocked / Pending |
| API | [N] | [N] | [N] | PASS / FAIL / NotRun / Blocked / Pending |
| CLI | [N] | [N] | [N] | PASS / FAIL / NotRun / Blocked / Pending |

Omit rows for platforms that were not requested.

**Platform notes**: [any platform-specific observations not captured in pass/fail]

Any platform with one or more FAIL checks contributes to the overall FAIL verdict.

---

### Verdict: [PASS | PASS WITH WARNINGS | FAIL | INCOMPLETE]

- **FAIL**: an applicable required executed check failed, including automated,
  manual, data/performance and requested platform checks in every batch.
- **INCOMPLETE**: no observed required failure, but required NotRun/Blocked/Pending/
  Unknown, missing evidence or skipped required scope. Preserve each actual status.
- **PASS WITH WARNINGS**: every required smoke check actually passes with adequate
  exact evidence; only optional follow-up remains with owner/due phase.
- **PASS**: every required smoke check passes, with no pending required gaps.
  Unexecuted platform/product qualification never becomes actual runtime PASS.

`quick` proves only its disclosed checked scope. Omitted checks remain NotRun/
unreviewed and cannot satisfy full-smoke/strict obligations by omission.

````

---

## Phase 6: Write and Gate

Present the full report in conversation and reuse existing exact report path/effect authorization. Only for missing or materially new write scope ask:

"May I write this smoke check report to `production/qa/smoke-[date].md`?"

Write only when that exact report effect is covered by existing or newly obtained authorization.

When initialized and its named index effect is covered, update
`memory_bank/t3_archive/qa_evidence_index.md`:
- Type: `smoke-check`
- Evidence path: `production/qa/smoke-[date].md` (new revision on path collision)
- Verdict: PASS / FAIL / PASS WITH WARNINGS / INCOMPLETE and actual per-check truth
- Dedupe by evidence path for an authorized current pointer, retaining historical
  revision/input links. Report-write approval alone excludes this effect.
- Without Memory Bank use the report/conversation fallback, disclose absent
  optional index and do not initialize or imply governance activation.

After writing, deliver the gate verdict:

**If verdict is FAIL:**

"The smoke check failed. Do not hand off to QA until these failures are
resolved:

[List each failing automated test or smoke check with a one-line description]

Fix the failures and run `/smoke-check` again to re-gate before QA hand-off."

**If verdict is INCOMPLETE:** disclose required unavailable/unexecuted/pending checks and continue independent evidence work. Do not announce qualified hand-off.

**If verdict is PASS WITH WARNINGS:**

"Required smoke checks passed with optional warnings for the exact checked scope.

Advisory items to resolve before running `/story-done` on affected stories:
[list MISSING test evidence entries]

QA hand-off: share the verified actual QA-plan path and input binding selected
in Phase 1 with the qa-tester for that matched scope."

**If verdict is PASS:**

"Required smoke checks passed for the exact checked scope; broader runtime/platform/product qualification remains as actually recorded.

QA hand-off: share the verified actual QA-plan path and input binding selected
in Phase 1 with the qa-tester for that matched scope."

For either passing smoke verdict, if no usable plan is selected, replace the
plan hand-off instruction with the actual unresolved state and scoped `/qa-plan`
recommendation. Do not substitute an undated/synthesized path, write a plan,
auto-run QA or imply that plan-dependent hand-off is ready. The smoke outcome
still covers only its verified checks; required plan gaps remain INCOMPLETE.

---

## Collaborative Protocol

- NotRun is not PASS or observed FAIL; required incomplete checks yield INCOMPLETE.
  Keep current execution and sufficient permitted historical evidence separate.

- **Never auto-fix failures** — report them and state what must be resolved.
  Do not attempt to edit source code or test files.
- **PASS WITH WARNINGS** applies only to exact checked scope with every required check passing; warnings are optional. Each Story still needs required closure evidence.
- **`quick` argument** skips Phase 3 (coverage scan) and Phase 4 Batch 3.
  Use it for rapid re-checks after fixing a specific failure.
- Use `AskUserQuestion` for all manual smoke check verification.
- **Use named report-write authority**: Phase 6 continues under covered existing
  authorization; ask only for missing or materially new report paths/effects. Index/state effects need their own coverage.

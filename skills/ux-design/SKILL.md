## User Guide

- When to use: Guided, section-by-section UX spec authoring for a screen, flow, or HUD. Supports both game projects (player journey, HUD, game screens) and product projects (user flows, CLI interaction, API consumer journey). Reads concept doc and relevant CDDs for context-aware design guidance.
- Inputs: Command arguments: `/ux-design [screen/flow name] or 'hud' or 'patterns`; project artifacts referenced below; user decisions and approvals before writes.
- Outputs: Primary artifacts, reports, or conversation guidance described below; write files only after user approval.
- Memory-bank writes: None.
- Next steps: Follow the workflow hand-off or next-step guidance below; recommendations do not auto-run and require explicit user command/approval.

When this skill is invoked:

**Domain detection.** Read the concept document to determine domain:
- `design/cdd/game-concept.md` → **[游戏专用]** Game mode
- `design/cdd/product-concept.md` → **[通用产品]** Product mode

## 1. Parse Arguments & Determine Mode

**[游戏专用]** Game modes:

| Argument | Mode | Output file |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `hud` | HUD design | `design/ux/hud.md` |
| `patterns` | Interaction pattern library | `design/ux/interaction-patterns.md` |
| Any other value | UX spec for a screen or flow | `design/ux/[argument].md` |
| No argument | Ask the user | (see below) |

**[通用产品]** Product modes:

| Argument | Mode | Output file |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `patterns` | Interaction pattern library | `design/ux/interaction-patterns.md` |
| `workflow` or flow name | UX spec for a user workflow | `design/ux/[argument].md` |
| `cli` | CLI interaction design | `design/ux/cli-interaction.md` |
| `api` | API consumer journey | `design/ux/api-consumer-journey.md` |
| Any other value | UX spec for a screen or flow | `design/ux/[argument].md` |
| No argument | Ask the user | (see below) |

**If no argument is provided**, do not fail — ask instead. Use `AskUserQuestion`:
- **[游戏专用]** "What are we designing today?"
  Options: "A specific screen or flow", "The game HUD", "The interaction pattern library", "I'm not sure"
- **[通用产品]** "What are we designing today?"
  Options: "A specific screen or user flow", "CLI interaction design", "API consumer journey", "The interaction pattern library", "I'm not sure"

If the user selects a screen or flow name, normalize it to kebab-case
for the filename (e.g., "Main Menu" becomes `main-menu`).

---

## 2. Gather Context (Read Phase)

Read all relevant context **before** asking the user anything. The skill's value
comes from arriving informed.

### 2a: Required Reads

**[通用场景]** Read the concept document for the detected domain:
- **[游戏专用]** Read `design/cdd/game-concept.md` — if missing, warn and continue
- **[通用产品]** Read `design/cdd/product-concept.md` — if missing, warn and continue

### 2b: User Journey

**[游戏专用]** Read `design/player-journey.md` if it exists. Extract:
- Which journey phase(s) does this screen appear in?
- What is the player's emotional state on arrival?
- What player need is this screen serving?
- What critical moments does this screen deliver?

**[通用产品]** Read the User Journey section of the product concept doc. Extract:
- Which workflow step(s) does this screen/flow belong to?
- What is the user's goal at this point?
- What user need is this screen/flow serving?
- What is the primary JTBD (Job to Be Done) at this interaction point?

If no journey information exists, note the gap and proceed with assumptions.

### 2c: CDD UI Requirements

Glob `design/cdd/*.md` and grep for `UI Requirements` sections. Read any CDD whose
UI Requirements section references this screen by name or category.

These CDD UI Requirements are the **requirements input** to this spec. Collect them
as a list of constraints the spec must satisfy.

If designing the HUD, read ALL CDD UI Requirements sections — the HUD aggregates
requirements from every system.

### 2d: Existing UX Specs

Glob `design/ux/*.md` and note which screens already have specs. For screens that
will link to or from the current screen, read their navigation/flow sections to
find the entry and exit points this spec must match.

### 2e: Interaction Pattern Library

If `design/ux/interaction-patterns.md` exists, read the pattern catalog index
(the list of pattern names and their one-line descriptions). Do not read full
pattern details — just the catalog. This tells you which patterns already exist
so you can reference them rather than reinvent them.

### 2f: Visual / Product Style References

For game projects, check for `design/art/art-bible.md`. If found, read the
visual direction section. UX layout must align with the aesthetic commitments
already made.

For product projects, check for `design/brand/style-guide.md`. If found, read
brand tone, visual standards, docs imagery rules, and accessibility-constrained
color/typography commitments. For UI-heavy products, also check
`design/design-system.md`; if it exists, read component patterns and state
standards before writing screen or workflow specs.

### 2g: Accessibility Requirements

Check for `design/accessibility-requirements.md`. If found, read it. The spec
must satisfy the accessibility tier committed to there.

### 2h: Input Method (from Project Config)

Read `standards/technical-preferences.md` and extract the `## Input & Platform`
section. Store these values for use throughout the skill — they drive the
Interaction Map and inform accessibility requirements:

- **Input Methods** — e.g., Keyboard/Mouse, Gamepad, Touch, Mixed
- **Primary Input** — the dominant input for this game
- **Gamepad Support** — Full / Partial / None
- **Touch Support** — Full / Partial / None
- **Target Platforms** — for safe zone and aspect ratio decisions

If the section is unconfigured (`[TO BE CONFIGURED]`), ask once:
> "Input methods aren't configured yet. What does this game target?"
> Options: "Keyboard/Mouse only", "Gamepad only", "Both (PC + Console)", "Touch (mobile)", "All of the above"
>
> (Run `/setup-engine` to save this permanently so you won't be asked again.)

Store the answer for the rest of this session. Do **not** ask again per section
or per screen.

### 2i: Present Context Summary

Before any design work, present a brief summary to the user:

> **Designing: [Screen/Flow Name]**
> - Mode: [UX Spec / HUD Design / Pattern Library / CLI / API]
> - Journey phase(s) / Workflow step(s): [from concept doc or journey map, or "unknown — no journey map"]
> - CDD requirements feeding this spec: [count and names, or "none found"]
> - Related screens/flows already specced: [list, or "none yet"]
> - Known patterns available: [count, or "no pattern library yet"]
> - Accessibility tier: [from requirements doc, or "not yet defined"]
> - Input methods: [from technical-preferences.md, or "asked above"]

Then ask: "Anything else I should read before we start, or shall we proceed?"

---

## 2b. Retrofit Mode Detection

Before creating a skeleton, check if the target output file already exists.

Glob `design/ux/[filename].md` (where `[filename]` is the resolved output path from Phase 1).

**If the file exists — retrofit mode:**
- Read the file in full
- For each expected section, check whether the body has real content (more than a `[To be designed]` placeholder) or is empty/placeholder
- Present a section status summary to the user:

> "Found existing UX spec at `design/ux/[filename].md`. Here's what's already done:
>
> | Section | Status |
> |---------|--------|
> | Overview & Context | [Complete / Empty / Placeholder] |
> | Purpose & User Need | ... |
> | User Context & Journey Integration | ... |
> | Screen Layout & Information Architecture | ... |
> | Interaction Model | ... |
> | Feedback & State Communication | ... |
> | Accessibility | ... |
> | Edge Cases & Error States | ... |
> | Open Questions | ... |
>
> I'll work on the [N] incomplete sections only — existing content will not be overwritten."

- Skip Section 3 (skeleton creation) — the file already exists
- In Phase 4 (Section Authoring), only work on sections with Status: Empty or Placeholder
- Use `Edit` to fill placeholders in-place rather than creating a new skeleton

**If the file does not exist — fresh authoring mode:**
Proceed to Phase 3 (Create File Skeleton) as normal.

---

## 3. Create File Skeleton

After mode detection, read only the matching skeleton in [UX document skeletons](references/templates.md): screen/flow spec, HUD design, or interaction-pattern library. Obtain approval for the exact output path before creating it.

## 4. Section-by-Section Authoring

Walk through each section in order. For **each section**, follow this cycle:

```
Context  ->  Questions  ->  Options  ->  Decision  ->  Draft  ->  Approval  ->  Write
```

1. **Context**: State what this section needs to contain and surface any relevant
   constraints from context gathered in Phase 2.
2. **Questions**: Ask what is needed to draft this section. Use `AskUserQuestion`
   for constrained choices, conversational text for open-ended exploration.
3. **Options**: Where design choices exist, present 2-4 approaches with pros/cons.
   Explain reasoning in conversation, then use `AskUserQuestion` to capture the decision.
4. **Decision**: User picks an approach or provides custom direction.
5. **Draft**: Write the section content in conversation for review. Flag provisional
   assumptions explicitly.
6. **Approval**: "Does this capture it? Any changes before I write it to the file?"
7. **Write**: Use `Edit` to replace the `[To be designed]` placeholder with approved
   content. Confirm the write.

After writing each section, update `production/session-state/active.md`.

---

### Mode-Specific Section Guidance

Before authoring a section, read the matching mode and section in [UX section guidance](references/section-guidance.md). Load only the current mode. Its product/game branches, accessibility requirements, and specialist-delegation rules remain mandatory.

## 5. Cross-Reference Check

Before marking the spec as ready for review, run these checks:

**1. CDD requirement coverage**: Does every CDD UI Requirement that references
this screen have a corresponding element in this spec? Present any gaps.

**2. Pattern library alignment**: Are all interaction patterns used in this spec
referenced by name? If a new pattern was invented during this spec session, flag
it for addition to the pattern library:
> "This spec uses [pattern name], which isn't in the pattern library yet.
> Want to add it now, or flag it as a gap?"

**3. Navigation consistency**: Do the entry/exit points in this spec match the
navigation map in any related specs? Flag mismatches.

**4. Accessibility coverage**: Does the spec address the accessibility tier
committed to in `design/accessibility-requirements.md`? If not, flag open questions.

**5. Empty states**: Does every data-dependent element have an empty state defined?
Flag any that don't.

Present the check results:
> **Cross-Reference Check: [Screen Name]**
> - CDD requirements: [N of M covered / all covered]
> - New patterns to add to library: [list or "none"]
> - Navigation mismatches: [list or "none"]
> - Accessibility gaps: [list or "none"]
> - Missing empty states: [list or "none"]

---

## 6. Handoff

When all sections are approved and written:

### 6a: Update Session State

Update `production/session-state/active.md` with:
- Task: [screen-name] UX spec
- Status: Complete (or In Review)
- File: design/ux/[filename].md
- Sections: All written
- Next: [suggestion]

### 6b: Suggest Next Step

Before presenting options, state clearly:

> "This spec should be validated with `/ux-review` before it enters the
> implementation pipeline. The Pre-Production gate requires all key screen specs
> to have a review verdict."

Then use `AskUserQuestion`:
- "Run `/ux-review [filename]` now, or do something else first?"
  - Options:
    - "Run `/ux-review` now — validate this spec"
    - "Design another screen first, then review all specs together"
    - "Update the interaction pattern library with new patterns from this spec"
    - "Stop here for this session"

If the user picks "Design another screen first", add a note: "Reminder: run
`/ux-review` on all completed specs before running `/gate-check pre-production`."

### 6c: Cross-Link Related Specs

When other UX specs link to or from this screen, note which ones should reference
this spec. Do not edit those files without asking — just name them.

---

## 7. Recovery & Resume

If the session is interrupted (compaction, crash, new session):

1. Read `production/session-state/active.md` — it records the current screen
   and which sections are complete.
2. Read `design/ux/[filename].md` — sections with real content are done;
   sections with `[To be designed]` still need work.
3. Resume from the next incomplete section — no need to re-discuss completed ones.

This is why incremental writing matters: every approved section survives any
disruption.

---

## 8. Specialist Agent Routing

This skill uses `ux-designer` as the primary agent (set in frontmatter). For
specific sub-topics, additional context or coordination may be needed:

| Topic | Coordinate with |
|-------|----------------|
| Visual aesthetics, color, layout feel | `art-director` — UX spec defines zones; art defines how they look |
| Implementation feasibility (engine constraints) | `ui-programmer` — before finalizing component inventory |
| Gameplay data requirements | `game-designer` — when data ownership is unclear |
| Narrative/lore visible in the UI | `narrative-director` — for flavor text, item names, lore panels |
| Accessibility tier decisions | Handled by this session — owned by ux-designer |

When delegating to another agent via the Task tool:
- Provide: screen name, game concept summary, the specific question needing expert input
- The agent returns analysis to this session
- This session presents the agent's output to the user
- The user decides; this session writes to file
- Agents do NOT write to files directly — this session owns all file writes

---

## Collaborative Protocol

This skill follows the collaborative design principle at every step:

1. **Question -> Options -> Decision -> Draft -> Approval** for every section
2. **AskUserQuestion** at every decision point (Explain -> Capture pattern):
   - Phase 2: "Ready to start, or need more context?"
   - Phase 3: "May I create the skeleton?"
   - Phase 4 (each section): design questions, approach options, draft approval
   - Phase 5: "Run cross-reference check? What's next?"
3. **"May I write to [filepath]?"** before the skeleton and before each section write
4. **Incremental writing**: Each section is written to file immediately after approval
5. **Session state updates**: After every section write

**Aesthetic deference**: When layout or visual choices come down to personal taste,
present the options and ask. Do not select a layout because it is "standard" — always
confirm. The user is the creative director.

**Conflict surfacing**: When a CDD requirement and the available screen real estate
conflict, surface the conflict and present resolution options. Never silently drop
a requirement. Never silently expand the layout without flagging it.

**Never** auto-generate the full spec and present it as a fait accompli.
**Never** write a section without user approval.
**Never** contradict an existing approved UX spec without flagging the conflict.
**Always** show where decisions come from (CDD requirements, player journey, user choices).

Verdict: **COMPLETE** — UX spec written and approved section by section.

---

## Recommended Next Steps

- Run `/ux-review [filename]` to validate this spec before it enters the implementation pipeline
- Run `/ux-design [next-screen]` to continue designing remaining screens or flows
- Run `/gate-check pre-production` once all key screens have approved UX specs

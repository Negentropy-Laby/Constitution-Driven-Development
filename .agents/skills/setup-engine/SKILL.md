## User Guide

- When to use: Configure the project's technology foundation — game engine or general product stack. Pins the stack in INSTRUCTIONS.md, detects knowledge gaps, and populates reference docs via WebSearch when versions are beyond the LLM's training data.
- Inputs: Command arguments: `/setup-engine [engine | framework | stack] [version] | refresh | upgrade [old-ver] [new-ver] | no args for guided selection`; project artifacts referenced below; user decisions and approvals before writes.
- Outputs: Primary artifacts, reports, or conversation guidance described below; write files only after user approval.
- Memory-bank writes: `memory_bank/t1_axioms/tech_context.md`.
- Next steps: Follow the workflow hand-off or next-step guidance below; recommendations do not auto-run and require explicit user command/approval.

When this skill is invoked:

## 1. Parse Arguments

Five modes:

- **Full spec**: `/setup-engine godot 4.6` or `/setup-engine django 5.1` — stack and version provided
- **Stack only**: `/setup-engine unity` or `/setup-engine react` — stack provided, version will be looked up
- **No args**: `/setup-engine` — fully guided mode (domain detection, then recommendation + version)
- **Refresh**: `/setup-engine refresh` — update reference docs (see Section 10)
- **Upgrade**: `/setup-engine upgrade [old-ver] [new-ver]` — migrate to a new version (see Section 11)

**Domain detection.** The argument usually reveals the domain:
- **游戏专用 hints**: godot, unity, unreal, ue5, game engine → game mode
- **通用产品 hints**: python, django, fastapi, react, nextjs, node, rust, go, postgres, redis, docker → product mode
- **Ambiguous**: ask during guided mode

Sections below are marked **[通用场景]** (both domains), **[游戏专用]** (game-domain), or **[通用产品]** (product-domain).

---

## 2. Guided Mode (No Arguments)

If no stack is specified, run an interactive selection process.

### [通用场景] Check for existing concept

- **游戏专用**: Read `design/cdd/game-concept.md` if it exists — extract genre, scope, platform targets, art style, team size, and any engine recommendation from `/brainstorm`
- **通用产品**: Read `design/cdd/product-concept.md` if it exists — extract platform targets, stack preferences, performance needs, and any tech recommendation from `/brainstorm`. Also read `memory_bank/t1_axioms/tech_context.md` if it exists.

If no concept exists, inform the user:
- **游戏专用**: "No game concept found. Consider running `/brainstorm` first — it will recommend an engine."
- **通用产品**: "No product concept found. Consider running `/brainstorm` first — it will help identify stack requirements."

### [通用场景] Prior experience (ask first, always)

Use `AskUserQuestion`:
- Prompt: "Have you worked in any of these before?"

- **游戏专用** Options: `Godot` / `Unity` / `Unreal Engine 5` / `Multiple — I'll explain` / `None of them`
- **通用产品** Options: `Python (Django, FastAPI, Flask)` / `JavaScript/TypeScript (React, Next.js, Node)` / `Rust` / `Go` / `Multiple — I'll explain` / `None of them`

If they pick a specific stack → recommend it. Prior experience outweighs all other factors. Confirm with them and skip the matrix.

---

### Technology Selection Reference

When guided mode needs an engine, language, framework, or deployment-stack decision, read the matching domain section in [stack selection](references/stack-selection.md). Load only the options relevant to the detected project domain and user constraints.

## 3. Look Up Current Version

[通用场景] Once the stack is chosen:

- If version provided → use it
- If no version → WebSearch: `"[stack] latest stable version [current year]"`
- Confirm: "The latest stable [stack] is [version]. Use this?"

---

## 4. Update INSTRUCTIONS.md Technology Stack

Read `INSTRUCTIONS.md` and show the user the proposed Technology Stack changes.
Ask: "May I write these settings to `INSTRUCTIONS.md`? Writing it also regenerates every runtime root-instruction adapter declared in `cdd-manifest.toml`: `python scripts/sync_adapters.py --write --class root-instructions`."

Wait for confirmation before making any edits. After writing `INSTRUCTIONS.md`, run that regeneration command so the runtime files stay in sync.

Update the Technology Stack section, replacing the `[CHOOSE]` placeholders with the actual values:

**[游戏专用]** Engine templates:

### Language Selection (Godot only)

If Godot was chosen, ask the user which language to use **before** showing the proposed Technology Stack:

> "Godot supports two primary languages:
>
>   **A) GDScript** — Python-like, Godot-native, fastest iteration. Best for beginners, solo devs, and teams coming from Python or Lua.
>   **B) C#** — .NET 8+, familiar to Unity developers, stronger IDE tooling (Rider / Visual Studio), slight performance advantage on heavy logic.
>   **C) Both** — GDScript for gameplay/UI scripting, C# for performance-critical systems. Advanced setup — requires .NET SDK alongside Godot.
>
> Which will this project primarily use?"

Record the choice. It determines the INSTRUCTIONS.md template, naming conventions, specialist routing, and which agent is spawned for code files throughout the project.

**For Godot** — use the template matching the language chosen above. Read [Godot language configuration](references/godot-language-configuration.md) for all three variants (GDScript, C#, Both).

**Unity:**
```markdown
- **Engine**: Unity [version]
- **Language**: C#
- **Build System**: Unity Build Pipeline
- **Asset Pipeline**: Unity Asset Import Pipeline + Addressables
```

**Unreal:**
```markdown
- **Engine**: Unreal Engine [version]
- **Language**: C++ (primary), Blueprint (gameplay prototyping)
- **Build System**: Unreal Build Tool (UBT)
- **Asset Pipeline**: Unreal Content Pipeline
```

**[通用产品]** Stack template:
```markdown
- **Language**: [Python / TypeScript / Rust / Go / ...] [version]
- **Framework**: [FastAPI / React / Django / ...] [version]
- **Runtime**: [CPython 3.12 / Node.js 22 / ...]
- **Database**: [PostgreSQL / SQLite / DuckDB / ...]
- **Build System**: [pip / npm / cargo / make / ...]
- **CI/CD**: [GitHub Actions / GitLab CI / ...]
```

---

## 5. Populate Technical Preferences

Read [technology preference templates](references/technical-preferences.md) after the stack is selected. Load the shared sections plus only the chosen engine/language/framework branch. Preserve its collaborative approval boundary before writing project instructions.

## 6. Determine Knowledge Gap

[通用场景] Check whether the version is beyond LLM training data.

**Known approximate coverage** (update as models change): LLM cutoff: **May 2025**

**[游戏专用]** Engine baselines: Godot ~4.3, Unity ~2023.x/early 6000.x, Unreal ~5.3/early 5.4

**[通用产品]** Framework baselines: Python ~3.12, Django ~5.0, FastAPI ~0.111, React ~18.3, Next.js ~14, Node ~22, TS ~5.4, Rust ~1.78, Go ~1.22

Compare chosen version against baselines:
- **Within training data** → LOW RISK — reference docs optional
- **Near the edge** → MEDIUM RISK — reference docs recommended
- **Beyond training data** → HIGH RISK — reference docs required

---

## 7. Populate Reference Docs

[通用场景]

### If WITHIN training data (LOW RISK):

Create a minimal `docs/engine-reference/<engine>/VERSION.md`:

```markdown
# [Engine] — Version Reference

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Engine Version** | [version] |
| **Project Pinned** | [today's date] |
| **LLM Knowledge Cutoff** | May 2025 |
| **Risk Level** | LOW — version is within LLM training data |

## Note

This engine version is within the LLM's training data. Engine reference
docs are optional but can be added later if agents suggest incorrect APIs.

Run `/setup-engine refresh` to populate full reference docs at any time.
```

Do NOT create breaking-changes.md, deprecated-apis.md, etc. — they would
add context cost with minimal value.

**[通用产品]** For general stacks, create the equivalent file at `docs/reference/<stack>/VERSION.md`:

```markdown
# [Stack] — Version Reference

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Stack Version** | [version] |
| **Project Pinned** | [today's date] |
| **LLM Knowledge Cutoff** | May 2025 |
| **Risk Level** | LOW — version is within LLM training data |

## Note

This stack version is within the LLM's training data. Stack reference
docs are optional but can be added later if agents suggest incorrect APIs.

Run `/setup-engine refresh` to populate full reference docs at any time.
```

Do NOT create breaking-changes.md, deprecated-apis.md, etc. for LOW RISK — they would
add context cost with minimal value.

### If BEYOND training data (MEDIUM or HIGH RISK):

Create the full reference doc set by searching the web:

1. **Search for the official migration/upgrade guide**:
   - `"[stack] [old version] to [new version] migration guide"`
   - `"[stack] [version] breaking changes"`
   - `"[stack] [version] changelog"`
   - `"[stack] [version] deprecated API"`

2. **Fetch and extract** from official documentation:
   - Breaking changes between each version from the training cutoff to current
   - Deprecated APIs with replacements
   - New features and best practices

Ask: "May I create the reference docs under `docs/[engine-]reference/<stack>/`?"

Wait for confirmation before writing any files.

3. **Create the full reference directory**:
   ```
   docs/engine-reference/<engine>/
   ├── VERSION.md              # Version pin + knowledge gap analysis
   ├── breaking-changes.md     # Version-by-version breaking changes
   ├── deprecated-apis.md      # "Don't use X → Use Y" tables
   ├── current-best-practices.md  # New practices since training cutoff
   └── modules/                # Per-subsystem references (create as needed)
   ```

4. **Populate each file** using real data from the web searches, following
   the format established in existing reference docs. Every file must have
   a "Last verified: [date]" header.

5. **For module files**: Only create modules for subsystems where significant
   changes occurred. Don't create empty or minimal module files.

**[通用产品]** For general stacks, use `docs/reference/<stack>/` as the root path instead of `docs/engine-reference/`.

---

## 8. Update INSTRUCTIONS.md Import

Ask: "May I update the `@` import in `INSTRUCTIONS.md` to point to the new reference? This regenerates every runtime root-instruction adapter declared in `cdd-manifest.toml`: `python scripts/sync_adapters.py --write --class root-instructions`."

Wait for confirmation, then update. After the import edit, run that regeneration command.

```markdown
## Version Reference

@docs/engine-reference/<engine>/VERSION.md
```

If the previous import pointed to a different engine (e.g., switching from
Godot to Unity), update it.

**[通用产品]** For general stacks, the import points to `docs/reference/<stack>/VERSION.md` instead.

---

## 9. Update Agent Instructions

[通用场景] Ask before editing. Verify agents have a "Version Awareness" section:
1. Read VERSION.md
2. Check deprecated APIs before suggesting code
3. Check breaking changes for version transitions
4. Use WebSearch to verify uncertain APIs

---

## 10. Refresh Subcommand

[通用场景] `/setup-engine refresh`:

1. Read existing VERSION.md
2. WebSearch for new releases since last verification
3. Update all reference docs with new findings
4. Update "Last verified" dates
5. Report what changed

---

## 11. Upgrade Subcommand

[通用场景] `/setup-engine upgrade [old-ver] [new-ver]`:

### Step 1 — Read Current Version State

Read the VERSION.md to confirm the current pinned version, risk level, and any
migration note URLs already recorded. If `old-ver` was not provided as an
argument, use the pinned version from this file.

- **游戏专用**: `docs/engine-reference/<engine>/VERSION.md`
- **通用产品**: `docs/reference/<stack>/VERSION.md`

### Step 2 — Fetch Migration Guide

Use WebSearch and WebFetch to locate the official migration guide between
`old-ver` and `new-ver`:

- Search: `"[stack] [old-ver] to [new-ver] migration guide"`
- Search: `"[stack] [new-ver] breaking changes changelog"`
- Fetch the migration guide URL from VERSION.md if one is already recorded,
  or use the URL found via search.

Extract: renamed APIs, removed APIs, changed defaults, behavior changes, and
any "must migrate" items.

### Step 3 — Pre-Upgrade Audit

Scan `src/` for code that uses APIs known to be deprecated or changed in the
target version. File types depend on domain:
- **游戏专用**: `.gd`, `.cs`, `.cpp`, `.h`
- **通用产品**: `.py`, `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.rs`, `.go`

Use Grep to search for deprecated API names extracted from the migration
guide (e.g., old function names, removed modules, changed imports).
List each file that matches, with the specific API reference found.

Present the audit results as a table:

```
Pre-Upgrade Audit: [stack] [old-ver] → [new-ver]
==================================================

Files requiring changes:
  File                    | Deprecated API Found    | Effort
  ----------------------- | ----------------------- | ------
  src/api/users.py        | deprecated_function()   | Low
  src/models/base.py      | removed_decorator       | Medium

Breaking changes to watch for:
  - [change description from migration guide]
  - [change description from migration guide]

Recommended migration order (dependency-sorted):
  1. [module with fewest dependencies first]
  2. [next module]
  ...
```

If no deprecated APIs are found in `src/`, report: "No deprecated API usage
found in src/ — upgrade may be low-risk."

### Step 4 — Confirm Before Updating

Ask the user before making any changes:

> "Pre-upgrade audit complete. Found [N] files using deprecated APIs.
> Proceed with upgrading VERSION.md to [new-ver]?
> (This will update the pinned version and add migration notes — it does NOT
> change any source files. Source migration is done manually or via stories.)"

Wait for explicit confirmation before continuing.

### Step 5 — Update VERSION.md

After confirmation:

1. Update `docs/[engine-]reference/<stack>/VERSION.md`:
   - `Version` → `[new-ver]`
   - `Project Pinned` → today's date
   - `Last Docs Verified` → today's date
   - Re-evaluate and update the `Risk Level`
   - Add a `## Migration Notes — [old-ver] → [new-ver]` section
     containing: migration guide URL, key breaking changes, deprecated APIs
     found in this project, and recommended migration order from the audit

2. If `breaking-changes.md` or `deprecated-apis.md` exist in the reference
   directory, append the new version's changes to those files.

### Step 6 — Post-Upgrade Reminder

After updating VERSION.md, output:

```
VERSION.md updated: [stack] [old-ver] → [new-ver]

Next steps:
1. Migrate deprecated API usages in the [N] files listed above
2. Run /setup-engine refresh after upgrading the actual package to
   verify no new deprecations were missed
3. Run /architecture-review — the version upgrade may invalidate ADRs that
   reference specific APIs or framework capabilities
4. If any ADRs are invalidated, run /propagate-design-change to update
   downstream stories
```

---

## 11b. Sync T1 Technical Context

After the user approves the technology configuration writes, if `memory_bank/`
exists, update `memory_bank/t1_axioms/tech_context.md`.

Do not create `memory_bank/` from `/setup-engine`. If it does not exist, keep
the normal writes and tell the user to run `/constitute` to establish the
memory_bank governance control plane.

Record these fields in `memory_bank/t1_axioms/tech_context.md`:

- Selected engine, language, framework, runtime, and database as applicable
- Pinned version for each selected technology
- Reason chosen
- Alternatives rejected
- Compatibility constraints
- Knowledge risk
- Reference docs generated
- Last verified date

This T1 context is a memory mirror of the technical decision. `INSTRUCTIONS.md`,
`standards/technical-preferences.md`, and the generated reference docs remain
the detailed working sources.

---

```

Verdict: **COMPLETE** — stack configured and reference docs populated.

---

## Guardrails

[通用场景]
- NEVER guess a version — verify via WebSearch or user confirmation
- NEVER overwrite existing reference docs without asking
- If reference docs exist for a different stack, ask before replacing
- Always show the user what you're about to change before making INSTRUCTIONS.md edits
- If WebSearch returns ambiguous results, show the user and let them decide
- Never add speculative dependencies to Allowed Libraries

**[游戏专用]** Godot GDScript guardrail: When user chose GDScript, write Language as exactly "GDScript" — no additions. Do NOT append "C++ via GDExtension".

---

## Appendix A — Godot Language Configuration

For Godot projects only, read [Godot language configuration](references/godot-language-configuration.md) before updating language-specific instructions or specialist routing. Skip this reference for every other stack.
